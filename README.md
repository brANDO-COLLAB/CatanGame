# For Graders

To see our code, go to Assets/Scripts.

If it's necessary to see our code in Unity, refer to the "For Devs" section.

# For Devs

## Setting Up

### [1]
First, download and install the following:
 - GitHub Desktop (Or your git client of choice, if you have one)
 - Unity Hub
 - In Unity Hub, Unity 2021.3.x (LTS)
    - x is the latest release of this version
 - OPTIONAL but VERY NICE TO HAVE: Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022.
    - NOT Visual Studio Code
    - When running the Visual Studio Installer, make sure "Game Development With Unity" is selected. This has some useful tools that'll make development a lot easier.
    
If anything here asks you to pay for something, DON'T. There's a free version of everything here that we can use educationally. Get the personal/community/free versions of everything.

### [2]
Clone the repository to your pc using GitHub Desktop (or other)

### [3]
Open Unity Hub, click "Open," navigate to the folder you cloned the project in, and click "Open."
 - Unity might yell at you about having the wrong editor version. This is OKAY, and you can simply ignore and open with your current version IF you're using 2021.3.something.

### [4]
You are now ready to develop.

## Making Changes

You have some code you've written that works with the project, and you want to upload it to the repository. 

### [1]
Make sure you've made the changes in the repository on your device. If your code isn't running with the rest of the code, you'll need to drag it into the project and integrate it.

### [2]
Open your git client. You should see a list of the changes you've made to the repo.
 - To make a new branch, go to the list of branches at the top, type the name of your new branch, and click "New Branch." Then click "Publish Branch."
 - Then, make sure you're in your new branch, and get ready to commit your changes. Under summary, type a commit summary, and hit "commit." This commits the changes you've made to your local version of the repository.
 - Next, hit "Push." Your changes are now online, albiet in a separate branch.
 - To merge with main, click to open a pull request. GitHub should take you through it. Once you're done with that, there should be an option to merge the pull request.
 - Merge, and you're done.
